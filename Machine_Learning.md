# Machine Learning

In this guide, let's check an and 

## Supervised Learning

### Regression

Check an example in notebook! 

* Linear Regression
```
y=α0+α1x
```

* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Bayesian

### Classification

Check an example in notebook!

* Logic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* KNN


### Enssemble/Stacking

Let's try out these algorithms on a Kaggle compettion

To increase the accuraccy there are many solutions

Let's visualizae the performance with manifold

We can also build an interactive streamlit app from our trained model.

## unsupervised Learning

* K-means
* PCA
