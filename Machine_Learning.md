## Supervised Learning

### Regression

Check an example in [notebook](notebooks/data-analysis/Boston_House_Price.ipynb)! 

* Linear Regression

The simplest LR is as below. It can be multi-dimentional depending on your input. It can also be Polynomial equation.

```
y=ax+b
```
   * Lasso Regression (L1)
   * Ridge Regression (L2)
   
It can easily see which component is more important, but hard to include interaction between features.

Don't use it unless the feature is pure independent. 
   
* Decision Tree


* Random Forest


* Bayesian

### Classification
