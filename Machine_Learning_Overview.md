# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression

### Logic Regression

### Decision Tree

### Random Forest

### Gradient Boosting

## KNN

### Naive Bayes

### Bayesian

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Enssemble Algorithms

Let's try out these algorithms on a Kaggle compettion

To increase the accuraccy there are many solutions

Let's visualizae the performance with manifold

We can also build an interactive streamlit app from our trained model.

## unsupervised Learning
