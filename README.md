# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries. It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. 


### Quick Guide to get the Taste

* Quick developing and deployment :

   * Build your first machine learning service from Tensorflow Hub with Streamlit[`Streamlit Demo`](demo/simple/image_cls)

* Develop and explaing your own model:

   * Normalization, Regularization, Dropout, Activation Function, Loss Function, Optimization for your model [`notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price_NN_xAI.ipynb)
   * Explainable Machine Learning [`Notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price.ipynb) [`Streamlit Demo`](https://explainable-machine-learning.herokuapp.com/)
   
   Check here to dive deeper for debugging your model and more!

* Deploy your model service![`link`]()

   Check here to see how production level model works(MLOps.md)

* Not just Dataset, get your own data!['Link'](Data_Engineering.md)
