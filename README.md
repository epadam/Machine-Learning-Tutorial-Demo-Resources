# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and notes yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also pratical applications. 

If you want a quick tutorial of machine learning.

[Course 101 (1) Train and deploy a Image Classifier on the web]()

[Course 101 (2) Train and deploy a Sentiment Classifier wit on the web]()

[Course 101 (3) Train and deploy a Temperature Forcasting which can continual learning to improve the prediction on the web]()

[Course 101 (4) How to visualize feature map and filter of your CNN model]()

[Course 101 (5)]()

Advanced:
[Monitor your model with ElasticSearch]()




It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. It also answers common questions of machine learning. 
You can find collections of most useful frameworks and tools for machine learning in this repo as well.

I hope you can get good ideas of different machine learning challenges not just model build but also  and find the resources you need in this repo.

A [roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/) of becoming a machine learning engineer or data engineer from AM.ai is also very helpful guideline to check.

You can follow the order to learn machine learning or select the topic you are interested below:

We can first start with handling the data.
