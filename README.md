# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries. It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. 

### Quick Notebook Lists

Please check all notebooks [here](notebooks/)!!

### Quick Guide

Simple:

* [House Price Predction with Interpretible Machine Learning and Deep Learning in notebook](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price.ipynb)

* [Sklearn Tutorial](notebooks/data-analysis/sklearn.ipynb)

* [Neural Network Explore Normalization, Regularization, Dropout, Activation Function, Loss Function, Optimization, Visualization and Interpretation](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price_NN_xAI.ipynb)

* [Build your first image classifier demo from Tensorflow Hub (Using Streamlit)](demo/simple/image_cls)

* [Train and track your model with MLflow]()

* [Deploy a machine learning model using torchserve or tensorflow serving]()
