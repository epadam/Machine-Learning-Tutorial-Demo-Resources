# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

Have you ever wanted to learn machine learning, but get confused by all the terms in machine learning and don't know how and where to apply it? And you are afraid what you learn is not out-dated?

Many learning resources only focus on model development, without telling you other important parts like responsible AI, model deployment and monitoring. 

Personally I prefer a site that can give me the whole scope that I can know where I am in the machine learning world and what else is still missing.

If you feel the same, this is the resource gives you from the basic machine learning practice, debugging to production machine learning. Your model can really be deployed in production not just a jupyter notebook.

# Basic

## Understand the algorithm and practice with dataset in notebook!

## Deploy a model/Build an app!

# Advanced

## Understand your model better! Debuggin and explain your model with explainable AI

## [Not just Dataset, get your own data and build your own data pipeline!](Data_Engineering.md)

## Go to production level machine learning[(MLOps)](https://github.com/epadam/production-level-machine-learning)

model tracking, pipeline, deploying, monitoring

## Build fancy applications

Chatbot? Android App
