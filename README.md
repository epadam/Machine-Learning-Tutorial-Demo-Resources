# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

When I started to learn machine learning, I didn't find tutorials that give you the whole pictures of machine learning.

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries.

Please check and run the code yourself

### Quick Guide to get the Taste

* Quick developing and deployment :

   * Build your first machine learning service from Tensorflow Hub with Streamlit[`Streamlit Demo`](demo/simple/image_cls)

* Develop and explaing your own model:

   * Normalization, Regularization, Dropout, Activation Function, Loss Function, Optimization for your model [`notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price_NN_xAI.ipynb)
   * Explainable Machine Learning [`Notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price.ipynb) [`Streamlit Demo`](https://explainable-machine-learning.herokuapp.com/)
   
   Check here to dive deeper for debugging your model and more!

* Deploy your model service![`link`]()

   Check [here]((https://github.com/epadam/production-level-machine-learning) to see how to manage a machine learning project!!

* Not just Dataset, get your own data!['Link'](Data_Engineering.md)
