# ML Training

## Basic Methods

### Loss Function

### Optimization

## Supervised Learning

## Semi-Supervised Learning (mix labeled and unlabeled data)

## Self-Supervised Learning (Unsupervised Learning)

Self-supervised learning means training the models without labeled data. 

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning dominates the machine learning today. CV mostly benefit from supervised learning and transfer the features learned to similar tasks. NLP on the other hands benefit more from self-supervised learning. These pre-trained models show incredible performances in many tasks, such as Bert, GPT-2.

## Federated Learning

Federated learning can train the model without upload the data to a single machine and keeps the data at local machine.
