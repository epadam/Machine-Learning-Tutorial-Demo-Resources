# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries. It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. 

### Quick Lists

Please check all notebooks [here](notebooks/)!!

### Quick Guide

Simple:

* [Deploy your first image classifier using streamlit from Tensorflow Hub](demo/simple/tensorhub)

* [Predict House Price with ML and build a Demo]()

* [Track your model with MLflow]()

Medium:

* [How to deploy the a production ready model](MLOps.md)

* [How to use ElasticSearch for model monitoring]()

* [How to deploy a machine learning model using torchserve]()

### All the demos

* [CV Tasks Overview Demo](): Including Intepretity

* [Information Extraction Demo](): OCR tasks

* [NLP Tasks Overview Demo]()

* [Rasa QA chatbot with Haystack]()

* [Spectrum Classifier Demo]()

* [Sales Prediction Demo]()
