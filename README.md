# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries. It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. 



### Quick Guide

* Quick Developing and Deployment:

   * Build your first machine learning service from Tensorflow Hub [`Streamlit Demo`](demo/simple/image_cls)

* Tweak your model:

   * Normalization, Regularization, Dropout, Activation Function, Loss Function, Optimization, Visualization and Interpretation in Nueral Network [`notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price_NN_xAI.ipynb)

* Explaining your Models:

   * Explainable Machine Learning [`Notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price.ipynb) [`Streamlit Demo`](https://explainable-machine-learning.herokuapp.com/)

* Deploy a machine learning model using torchserve/tensorflow serving [`Demo`]()

* MLOps

   * How to manage machine learning models in production [`check here`](MLOps.md)

   * Use Prometheus for model monitoring [`check here`]()
