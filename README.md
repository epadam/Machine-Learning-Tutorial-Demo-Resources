# Machine Learning Tutorial, Demo and Resources

The best way to learn machine learning is to build tutorials and demos yourself. That is the reason why this repository exists. It covers from basic knowledge to modern research and also useful tools and libraries. It includes many jupyter notebooks and real demo. 



### Quick Guide

* Quick developing and deployment:

   * Build your first machine learning service from Tensorflow Hub with Streamlit[`Streamlit Demo`](demo/simple/image_cls)

* Tweak your model:

   * Normalization, Regularization, Dropout, Activation Function, Loss Function, Optimization, Visualization and Interpretation in Nueral Network [`notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price_NN_xAI.ipynb)

* Explain your model:

   * Explainable Machine Learning [`Notebook`](notebooks/data-analysis/house_price.ipynb) [`Streamlit Demo`](https://explainable-machine-learning.herokuapp.com/)

* Deploy a machine learning model using torchserve/tensorflow serving [`Demo`]()

* Production level machine learning (MLOps):

   * How to manage machine learning models in production [`link`](MLOps.md)
   
   * Deploy a continuous training model with Kubeflow [`github`]()

   * Use Prometheus for model monitoring [`github`]()

* Don't forget data. 
   *  Airflow with Spark
   *  Streaming data with Kafka
