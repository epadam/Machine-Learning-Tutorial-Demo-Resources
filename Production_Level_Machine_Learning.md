# Production Level Machine Learning (MLOps)

Machine learning models development is only little part of the whole ML system.

Let's follow the steps beflow to build a machine learning service on GCP.

1. Data Acquisition and ETL Process (Fetch data from internet )

Kafka, Spark

2. Data Validation/Data Annotation and Store.

Let's use labeling tools 

Until here, data should be organized in better way.

3. Data preprocessing/


4. model training and tracking
   * Early Stopping
   * checked point
  
We can fetch the data in bigQuery and do some preprocessing.

Let's orchastrate a pipeline for machine learning pipeline

Here the most convenient way is Jupyter Notebook, you can also use H2O

You can also use autoML to automatically build the model, but it would take some time.

We can use MLflow or Tensorboard to evaluate different model or hyperparameters.

5. Model Inspection and Explanation

Here we can use Manifold, SHAP for explanation to avoid bias and misbehavior

It would be nice if there is an interactive report that you can show the EDA and explanbility

6. Model Deployment
    * saved model format

Let's convert our model to the format we want for serving
(Depending on the scenario, you might need to give explanation for every single inference like medical usage or)

You may need some optimization to reduce the cost of inference, 


7. Model Performance Monitoring
   * Data Quality
     * Data Drift
     * Outlier detection
   * Metrics 
   * Concept Drift
   * Concerted adversaries
   

What can be monitored from our model? 

* Concept drift

* equipment related index

Let's use Elasticsearch APM to monitor our model
