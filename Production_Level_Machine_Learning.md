# Production Level Machine Learning (MLOps)

Machine learning models development is only little part of the whole ML system.

Let's follow the steps beflow to build a machine learning service on GCP.

1. Data Acquisition and ETL Process (Fetch data from internet )

Kafka, Spark

2. Data Validation/Data Annotation and Store.

Let's use labeling tools 

3. Data preprocessing/model training and tracking

Here the most convinient way is Jupyter Notebook

We can use MLflow to evaluate our model.

4. Model Evalution and explaination

Here we can use Manifold, SHAP for explaniation

5. Model Development

Let's convert our model to the format we want for serving

6. Model performance monitoring

What can be monitored from our model?

Let's use Elasticsearch APM to monitor our model
