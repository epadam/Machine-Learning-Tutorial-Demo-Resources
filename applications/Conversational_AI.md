# Machine Learning for Conversational AI

Chatbot is probably the most challenging application in NLP. It requires almost all tasks above to give smooth communicating experience.
It can be simple Q&A chatbot, task specific cahtbot to open domain chatbot or all-in-one chatbot. 

A standard pipeline of chatbot is showing below. There are also research on end-to-end chatbot, however, it is harder to control currently.
