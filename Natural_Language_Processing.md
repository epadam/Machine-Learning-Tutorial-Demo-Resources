# Natural Language Processing

You can either check NLP models or NLP tasks first to get an overview of what NLP is dealing with.


## Language Models (Word Embedding)

Statistical Language Models

## Glove

## N-grams

## FastText

### Dialog System (Chatbot)

Chatbot is probably the most challenging application in NLP. It includes multiple NLP tasks, mostly NLU and NLG related tasks.
It ranges from simple Q&A chatbot, task specific cahtbot to open domain chatbot

##### NLU

##### Dialog State Tracking

##### Dialog Policy

##### NLG
