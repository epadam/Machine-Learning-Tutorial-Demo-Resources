## Robot Navigation

### Visual Only

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning

* Learning to Navigate in Cities Without a Map [`github`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00168)

#### Imitation Learning(supervised learning)

### SLAM available




## Robot Controlling

### Reinforcement Learning

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning

* End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies [`arXiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702)

### Imitation Learning

When the complexity is too large, imitation learning can help the agent learn fast. 

#### One shot imitation learning (meta learning)

* Synthetically Trained Neural Networks for Learning Human-Readable Plans from Real-World Demonstrations [`arXiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07054)
