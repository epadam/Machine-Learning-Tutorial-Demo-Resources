# Machine Learning

## Traditional Algorithms

### Regression

### Decision Tree

### Random Forest

### Bayesian

### Enssemble Algorithms

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Deep Learning

### CNN

### Feature Pyramid Networks

### Fully Convolutional Networks

### Capsule Neural Network

### Autoencoder

### Variational Autoencoder

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

### VAE-GAN

### Graph Networks

* Graph Convolutional Networks

### RNN

### LSTM

### Temporal Convolutional Network

### Attention

### Transformer

## ML Training

### Loss Function

### Optimization

### Regularization

### Batch Normalization

## Supervised Learning

## Semi-Supervised Learning (mix labeled and unlabeled data)

## Weakly Supervised Learning

## Self-Supervised Learning (Unsupervised Learning)

Self-supervised learning means training the models without labeled data. AutoEncoder, GAN are examples in CV, while pre-trained model like Bert is example in NLP.
