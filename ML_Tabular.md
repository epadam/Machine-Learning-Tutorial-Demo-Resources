# Machine Learning for Tabular Data

In this section we talk about tricks and tips for data analysis with machine learning. 

All the nodebooks in this section:

* Reggression:

  * [Boston House Price Prediction]()

* Classification:

  * [Cancer Prediction]()


## Data Collection (General Guide)

* What do you want to predict
* What and where to get your data
* If you need need ETL pipeline, check here: 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

You should know your data, here is what you can do for your data:

* Data Visualization
* Data Cleansing
   * Outlier Detection 
* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* Correlation Plot
* Feature Engineering
* Data Distribution Analysis
   * Does the feature need to be normal distributed?
   * For classification task, is the amount of data for each class even? do you need oversampling or undersampling
* Data Augmentation
   * DeltaPy⁠⁠ [`github`](https://github.com/firmai/deltapy)
