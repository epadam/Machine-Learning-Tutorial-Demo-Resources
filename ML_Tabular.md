# Machine Learning for Tabular Data

In this section we talk about tricks and tips for data analysis with machine learning. 

## What you have to think (General Guide)
* What do you want to predict
* What data source do you need, do you need ETL pipeline, use autoML for prediction?
* Is the model responsible?
