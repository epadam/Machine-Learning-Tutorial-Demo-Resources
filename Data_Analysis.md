# Data Analysis

In this tutorial we will go give general ideas of analysis for tabular data. For images and texts please refer to [Computer Vision](Computer_Vision.md) and [Natural Language Processing](Natural_Language_Processing.md)



## Explore Data Analysis(EDA)

When data is not sufficient, we can apply data augmentation. Please check [Data Engineering](Data_Engineering.md) for more information.

* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)


## Model Selection and Training

Basic theory of models please check [Machine Learning Overview](Machine_Learning_Overview.md)

### How to acchieve high accuracy

* Model Fusion
* Data Augmentation
